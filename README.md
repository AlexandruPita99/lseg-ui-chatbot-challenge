# LSEG UI Chatbot Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Node Versions

Please use node versions: `>=20.0.0 <21.0.0`. This is in order to ensure a smooth usage of the application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Functionality

- Click the `Floating Action Button` in the bottom right of the page
- Click the `Options` provided by the chatbot
- Sometimes an `error` may occur:
  - This is an intended behaviour generated by `src/utils/getRandomPromiseFailure`
  - In order to get back to the previous flows just `close the chatbot and reopen it`
